Tailwind iQ3 custom component for Home Assistant.

This integration is not final, and currently requires your Tailwind iQ3 device to be running beta firmware.

The integration will create one or more Cover entities for your garage door(s).
The state (open/closed) is updated every 10 seconds via local polling - no cloud connection is required.
